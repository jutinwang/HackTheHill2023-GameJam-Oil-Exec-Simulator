<h2>Team Gessoline is proud to present, Oil Tycoon: The best global warming PSA you'll ever experience!</h2>

Take control of an oil baron as you expand your company, grow your profits and watch the world burn around you.
Your actions have concequences, maybe not for yourself, but for billions of others. There's no way to stop it,
there's no happy ending, YOU are the villian!

This is our team's entry into <b>HACK THE HILL's Game Jam</b> presented by <b> MAKER JAM. </b>
The theme was to create a game that talks about an ecological crises.

We used <b>UNITY</b>, written in C# with animations and hand-drawn pixel graphics.
